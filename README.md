To get the you must have [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) installed and the executable on the path. You can find the latest version in their GitHub release page.

Once this is done, compile with :

```
jai main.jai
```

And run with :

```
./main.exe <path-to-how_to>
```

On windows, if you don't give a path, it will try to use `C:\jai\how_to`.
